		<p>Pokemon is a series developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo and the Pokemon Company making its initial release in the year of 1996. The franchise has always retained its role-playing genre throughout each main release and is approaching its eighth generation. More than 300 million Pokemon games have been sold worldwide on handheld consoles which makes the title Nintendo's second best selling game franchise.</p>

    <h2>Name</h2>
		<div class = "content-2">
		<p>The name Pokémon is the portmanteau of the Japanese brand "Pocket Monsters". The term "Pokémon", in addition to referring to the Pokémon franchise itself, also collectively refers to the 823 fictional species that have made appearances in Pokémon media as of the release of the seventh generation titles Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee! "Pokémon" is identical in the singular and plural, as is each individual species name; it is grammatically correct to say "one Pokémon" and "many Pokémon", as well as "one Pikachu" and "many Pikachu".</p>

    <h2>Generations</h2>
    <div class = "content-2">
    <p>All of the licensed Pokémon properties overseen by The Pokémon Company International are divided roughly by generation. These generations are roughly chronological divisions by release; every several years, when a sequel to the 1996 role-playing video games Pokémon Red and Green is released that features new Pokémon, characters, and gameplay concepts, that sequel is considered the start of a new generation of the franchise. The main Pokémon video games and their spin-offs, the anime, manga, and trading card game are all updated with the new Pokémon properties each time a new generation begins. Some Pokémon from the newer games appear in anime episodes or films months, or even years, before the game they were programmed for came out. The first generation began in Japan with Pokémon Red and Green on the Game Boy. The franchise began the seventh generation on November 18, 2016 with Pokémon Sun and Moon on the Nintendo 3DS. The most recent games in the main series, Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!, were released on the Nintendo Switch on November 16, 2018. Pokémon Sword and Shield will begin the eighth generation on the Nintendo Switch and are scheduled to be released in late 2019.</p>

    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <div class = "content-2">
    <p>The gameplay of the Pokémon video game series involves the catching and training of fictional creatures called "Pokémon" and using them to battle other Trainers. Each successive generation of games builds upon this concept by introducing new Pokémon, items, and gameplay concepts. Some of the general concepts were featured elsewhere in the franchise before being introduced to the games; double battles appeared in the anime long before appearing in the games, and Pokémon Abilities are similar to the Pokémon Powers introduced in the Pokémon Trading Card Game, which also introduced Shiny Pokémon, different colors of that type of the original Pokémon.<br>
      <br>
    Some Pokémon with very high stats and good moves are used in Pokémon competitive play, which requires more complex strategies than picking supereffective moves.</p>
